## Purpose

I created this project to practice some basic react as well as put out an electronic resume. The plan for this site will be update the way information is passed to have a config file so anyone can use my site as a template.

## Scripts

### `npm install` or `npm i`

This installs the dependencies required to run the app!

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
